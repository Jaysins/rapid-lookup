2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd rapid-lookup
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary variables, including MongoDB connection details and RapidAPI key.

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-rapidapi-key
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
